# Current assumptions

These may definitely be inaccurate, but they make things simpler in terms of simulating. 

1. Nonexistance of nuculei in "excited" states after decay.
    - For simplicity, let's just say that only "super excited" states exist (eg after fission), but not ones after simple decay. A photon would be emitted at decay rather than abit after decay. 
2. The mode a nuculei will decay in is fixed and will decay depending on whichever end result has the longest half life (and is most stable). 
    - This seems true for most cases I tested it for, when considering alpha, beta-, and beta+. It is not perfect. 
3. Decay via beta- of a super excited nuculei will ALWAYS release 1 neutron. 
4. Free neutrons will always be distributed among nuculei, with bigger masses linearly taking more free neutrons. 
5. Nuclear fission will always produce neutrons with a linearly distributed integer between 1 and 5. 
6. A neutron will always absorb into a nucleus, and will always push it into a super excited state.
    - if this nucleus undergoes beta- decay, it will also spit out a neutron, just like with fission.
